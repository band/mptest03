# 2022-08-17 Some Thoughts on One And/Or Two

Descartes separated the body from the mind;  
Do we still say that today?  

Nonetheless we tell ourselves to mind our bodies and embody our minds, or at least our thoughts, as if we can do something other than that.  

And in education it seems we have dissociated learning from experience so there are now two things: learning, and experience.  

wha? how that workin' out?  

There is a kind of monism about this dualism.
